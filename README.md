Fitbit Clock Face based on "<a href="https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-moment">Moment</a>" from Fitbit.

- Added Weather-Temperature/Location at the top of display (utilizing <a href="https://github.com/gregoiresage/fitbit-weather">Fitbit-Weather</a>)
- Bumped/beefed-up font-sizes/weights (I wear reading-glasses)

Mind this was developed/tested on/for a Fitbit Versa, but should work fine on an Ionic too.

If you want to try it out, you can click the below link on your mobile device where the fitbit app resides.

<b>Note:</b> This is just to get my hands dirty and learn how to make watch-faces on Fitbit devices. More to come probably :-).
