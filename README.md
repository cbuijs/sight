Fitbit Clock Face based on "<a href="https://github.com/Fitbit/sdk-moment">Moment</a>" from Fitbit.

- Added Weather-Temperature/Location at the top of display (utilizing <a href="https://github.com/gregoiresage/fitbit-weather">Fitbit-Weather</a>)
- Bumped/beefed-up font-sizes/weights (I wear reading-glasses)

Mind this was developed/tested on/for a Fitbit Versa, but should work fine on an Ionic too.

<b>Note:</b> This is just to get my hands dirty and learn how to make watch-faces on Fitbit devices. More to come probably :-).
